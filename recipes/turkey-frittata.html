    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple Italian egg dish, similar to an omelette or scrambled eggs.
        This dish is often made with which ingredients you have laying around.
        The <em>only</em> necessity is eggs and at least one filling.
    </p>

    <p>This take on the dish keeps it simple yet delicious.
        Feel free to forgo or add ingredients at your discretion.
        Never stress the specifics of the ingredients when making a Frittata,
        they nearly always turn out great.
