        <h2 class="head-bg">Description</h2>
        <p class="text"><strong>Frittata: </strong>A simple Italian egg dish, similar to an omelette or scrambled eggs.
            This dish is often made with whichever ingredients you have laying around.
            The <em>only necessity</em> is eggs and at least one filling.
        </p>

        <p class="text">This take on the dish keeps it simple yet delicious.
            Feel free to forgo or add ingredients at your discretion.
            Never stress the specifics of the ingredients when making a Frittata,
            they nearly always turn out great.

        <h2 class="head-bg">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small-medium frying pan add 1 tbsp olive oil and place over low-medium heat.</li>
            <li>Chop up your turkey into ~1cm squares and add to frying pan.</li>
            <li>Mince your shallots and garlic while making sure to stir your turkey.</li>
            <li>Once turkey is sufficiently browned add your chili oil, shallots, and garlic.</li>
            <li>Crack your eggs and scramble them, making sure to keep an eye on your pan.</li>
            <li>Once the shallots and garlic are <em>just barely</em> browning remove the pan from heat.</li>
            <li>Transfer the contents of the pan to the bowl of eggs and stir.</li>
            <li>Add 1 more tbsp of oil to the pan and turn the temperature to medium.</li>
            <li>Add your bowl of eggs and fillings to the pan and scramble.</li>
            <li>Once eggs are sufficiently scrambled but <em>still runny</em> flatten the mixture then cover the pan.
            </li>
            <li>While eggs are finishing up chop your cilantro or parsley.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes the frittata should be just barely runny on top.
                At this point throw your greens atop.</li>
            <li>If the frittata is too runny, flip it and let it cook for a minute. Keep in mind egg dishes continue to
                cook
                after removed from heat.</li>
            <li>Slide the frittata onto a plate, top it with freshly grated parmesan cheese and flakey salt.</li>
            <li>Slice into your frittata like a pizza if you're sharing or simply dig in if it's just for you!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
